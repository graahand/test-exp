1. News and report of 771,000 Nepali youths ventured abroad for foreign employment in FY 2022/23.According to the Foreign Employment Board, more than 600,000 individuals pursued foreign jobs in the year following the pandemic, and this number surged to over 750,000 in the last fiscal year.The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has led to a surge in Nepali youths seeking employment opportunities abroad, as opportunities within the country have become limited.

Krishna Prasad Bhusal, the information officer of the Ministry of Labor, emphasized that nearly all migrant workers from Nepal fall within the economically productive age group of 18 to 44 years. Over the past three years, half of these migrant workers were between the ages of 25 and 34 years old.

1. An article from Study Travel reports that more than 112,000 Nepalese studnets applied to study abroad last year. Students from Nepal looking to study long-term language programmes, vocational courses and university degrees overseas require a No Objection Certificate (NOC), and the government issued 112,593 in the fiscal year, covering 17th July 2023 to 15th July 2024.

https://studytravel.network/magazine/news/0/30780

The figure represented a slight decrease compared with 117,563 NOCs issued in 2022/23, but the number of Nepalese students heading abroad is still significantly higher than in previous years. Government data shows that there were 63,259 NOCs issued in 2018/19, and 24,824 provided in 2008/08.

Japan was the most popular destination in the [latest data set](https://moest.gov.np/post/3_669e3ec49d2f4) with 34,371 NOCs issued, followed by Canada with 15,982, Australia (14,372), the UK (13,339) and the USA (11,261).

1. The latest report from the [IRCC](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship.html) (Immigration, Regugees, and Citizenship Canada) suggests that nearly 16,000 Nepalese students visa for post-secondary studies in 2023. For comparison, Nepalese students accounted for just 0.2% of Canadian study permits issued for post-secondary studies in 2018.
    
    A report from [US Department of State-Bureau of Consular Affairs](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/legal/visa-law0/visa-statistics/nonimmigrant-visa-statistics.html), in just the first nine month of fiscal year 2024, the US already issued a record-high number of F-1 student visas to Nepalese students. 9200 Nepalese students were issues a student visa from October through June 2024. This is an increase of 61% over full-year 2023, and 49% more than full-year 2022—the previous full-year high.
    
    International student interest in the [UK](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/immigration-system-statistics-year-ending-march-2024/why-do-people-come-to-the-uk-to-study) dropped following significant policy changes in 2023. But as the new Labour government begins to establish their views on international education, Nepal may prove to be a critical source of students to buoy the UK’s international education sector moving forward. 
    
    More than 8,500 Nepalese students were issued a main applicant student visa to the UK in 2023, an increase of 83% over the previous year. Critically, **the 2,200 Nepalese students issued a student visa in Q1 2024 represent growth of 27% over Q1 2023**. Over this same time frame, the number of student visas issued to all international students to the UK dropped by 22%. In short, Nepalese students remain highly interested in an education in the UK post-policy changes.
    
    For Australia, the declination of the student visas can be seen in the given table: 
    
    | Year | Visa Granted (Australia) |
    | --- | --- |
    | 2018 | 17603 |
    | 2019 | 10,691 |
    | 2020 | 2,747 |
    | 2021 | 3,271 |
    | 2022 | 21,864 |
    | 2023 | 14,530 |
    | 2024 | 4,075 |
    |  |  |
