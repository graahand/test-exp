### Rest Area Locator App

# Introduction (Background Information & Literature/online survey

Rest areas are used to provide safe stops for drivers which allow passengers to use rest rooms and eating small and lightweight to stay energized and quick lunch on hectic time of today's world with no person wasting their time and working for survival. Any kinds of travel from basic transportations to long distance travel includes schdeuled rest which is indeed  very important. These are govenment-funded  facilities are not only build for passengers but also for driver to promote their wellbeing along with the safety of any other vehicles and self as well remain safe throughout the  travel. Problems like drowsiness, fatigue, physical discomfort back pain, emergency restrooms requires special attention for any individual inside a vehicle and road safety. Mount White Area on Pacific Motorway, Marsden park stop, windsor road are some major  stations for drivers. With the rise of rapid technological development we propose an web application for providing a platform which offers passengers and anyone  browsing a web information about those rest areas their precise GPS-based location and ability for users to access those rest areas directly from their own location using google map utility integrated within the web application. Users will be provided with the information including types of rest areas, precise co-ordinates obtained directly from google map, anmeties and facilities of the rest areas like charging for EVs and restrooms, operational and maintainence notes and alerts for effective travel (https://data.nsw.gov.au/data/dataset/2-nsw-rest-areas#:~:text=The%20NSW%20Rest%20Areas%20dataset,are%20available%20at%20each%20site). The application will be improvised on the basis of public feedbacks to address their atmost problems that can be solved with the advancing technology. Sydney metropolitan raidal roads and regional  highways will be more safer, effective and technology-assited enhancing the safety of the passengers and road itself. Our source of information related to rest  areas will be mostly based on the information accessed from official Transport for NSW Open Data Hub Page which allows access to information and datasets for AI appliication about rest areas in New South Wales, Australia. Regularly updated data in this official website will be 

Some notable features that will be implemented inside the web application are notifications for facility update, clean and smooth web experience along with registration and login  facility for effectively utilizing the features from the web application. Such technological adaptation are very essential for safety propose along with wellbeing of the society where we live in order to live happily, safely and with the pace of technology for easier access to information in zero cost. 

# Project Description

Our project mainly addresses the research and development of an web application system which will  allow the drivers and passengers of Sydney region by providing them with the very effective and useful platform for accessing  the information regarding the rest areas, their types according to needs, real time geolocation integrated through google maps and feature for user registration and login. The web  application is promised to be the one stop solution for all users publicy to access the information related to rest areason key highways in New South Wales. Our system will not only provide the priority to public vehicles but also to those huge truck operators and load carriers vehicles for their safe travel throughout the area of Sydney region. The information related to these areas are directly integrated and utilised from the API provided by Transport for New South Wales (TfNSW) which regularly updates the data in order to maintain the correct information flow related to these important infrastructure build by the government for public welfare and safety.

The application will include every information in very comprehensive manner with the very useful description regarding the rest areas throughout the road. Some notably included features for the web application that are proposed to be developed are  information regarding the rest areas and the anmeties such as parking spots,EV charging stations, rest rooms, picnic venue and so on. Additioanlly information including the alerts and notices for timely maintenance of the areas  will  be provided through the web application. Lastly, the real time geolocation will be another crucial feature  that will  be integrated via google map API for realtime location tracking and navigation along with guiding the users for nearest and suitable places for quick breaks and restroooms.

Accessing the features of the web application will requires users to create their account through registration and then login using the username and password set during the registration session. After loggin in to the system, user greeting will be followed by the list of near rest areas with the options of accesing the google map for reaching  those areas, distance between the user's location and the rest areas, the type of rest areas and their anmenties as well. These functional highlights will be complemented with minimalist and functional user interface and smooth user experience. Our project stands out in terms of automatic integration of government data with the web technology for internet presence and easy access to very relevant information for anyone residing on the sydney area. The proposed project will be directly benefited by the real time application programming interface provided by the NSW and its regular publication of the data for very correct information flow. 
The philosophy of simplicity, usability and utility will be the inspiring factors for the correct implementation and completion of the project during the project timeline. The main motive of the project will be to alleviate mental stress, fatigue and drowsiness problems in drivers along with better travelling experiences through short breaks during the long travel for passengers along with fuel stations for EV and engine-based vehicles. 


# Literature Review and Similar Work

The value of rest areas to the security of road passengers, the implementation of physical wellbeing, and the improvement of general road performance is a repeatedly emphasised finding of the growing body of interdisciplinary research on the topic. Some transportation research projects especially those that focused on long-haul logistics and highway operations revealed that assigned rest areas could drastically alleviate the stress and fatigue during long-travel time. Long-haul drivers more specifically rely on such spaces to fulfill both physiological and psychological needs, such as the consumption of food, a short rest, rest rooms, and the lack of driving. The importance of these stops is increased in the regions or national contexts that lack urban amenities, and the level of traffic in these areas is also huge. In their recently published review of the issues of transportation infrastructure safety, Budzynskia and Ciecha (2025) specifically note that the rest areas parts contain some of the most valuable elements of road safety infrastructure, having a direct impact on minimizing the fatigue-related incidents and crashes (mdpi.com; mdpi.com). Moreover, crashed investigations studies and meta-analytic reviews conducted globally reveal that the strategic location and spacing of rest facilities alongside major transport routes are highly linked to reduced cases of accidents on the roads due to drowsy driving, especially during the night-time hours and where there has been a high-stress level of transport.

Some of the national transportation safety plans, including Australia National Road Safety Strategy 2021-2030 and the internationally-approved Vision Zero initiative have specifically mentioned the availability of adequate and frequent rest areas as one of the most essential preventive measures in controlling vehicular accidents and managing driver wellbeing However,  even given this broad level of acceptability regarding the need, there have been very few scholarly, business, or even technical initiatives that have been concerned in developing the end-user digital systems systems that would ensure that data about rest areas is easily available, searchable, and usable by drivers. The highway departments and road authorities often construct generalized portal of infrastructure, open-data GIS maps or downloadable highway documents as PDFs to display routes and assets. Yet, such resources are often either fixed, obsolete, unresponsive, or intended to serve internal or administrative needs, as opposed to everyday needs of drivers. As an example, although there is a publicly accessible map of officially recognised rest areas, these resources are commonly filtered, customised, or user-added poorly.

Travel services such as trip planners or navigation systems on highways provide simple rest stop indicators, though these generally lack highly detailed filtering (i.e. lists only rest areas which contain disabled toilets, or areas with truck parking) or do not receive updates via government updates.Throughout our research on feasibility study, we found that there is no published case studies and open-access research reports describing or criticizing a web application feature-complete geospatial interactivity and user log-in as proposed in this project as customized to rest area listings. This has been done in the presence of lack of similar systems. We have assessed very similar technologies and data tools publicly available on other parts of the world. Transport for NSW and other government organizations in Australia have shown that open-data Geographic information system (GIS) applications can be most effective when presenting the public with the vital information on transport that can be easily used. The creation of Web-based maps using websites such as the Open Data Hub (data.nsw.gov.au) at NSW Government has provided citizens with access to a variety of datasets that deal with the routes and volume of transport, parking areas and roads construction. However, these tools are not meant only to be used and exploited by youthful planners or analysts but by ordinary and day-to-day users, who will see visual, interactive, and, frequently, real-time updates in transport conditions within Sydney or the larger New South Wales region. Such as an example, live traffic situations, road accidents or any unavailability of public transport or even online dashboards of freight performances are already open to the populace. These services span a gap in the raw data provided by the government, into the hands and use of the citizen, facilitating more civic engagement, openness and instant decision making when traveling. Similarly, our app idea is informed by this and in an attempt to provide a solution, focuses on rest-area data, another underused area, and reinvents it as an user-friendly design interface that considers the needs of the drivers preferably allowing them to travel securely and effectively.

## Advantages of Our Prototype vs Prior Approaches

Users will be able to filter the selection by the compatibility of a vehicle (e.g., light cars vs. heavy truck), particular facilities (e.g., EV charging, shaded seats, or a water fountain), and the even the distance to their current position along with different types of rest areas according to need. Current government provision of this sort of service lacks the specificity of the filtering mechanisms.

Using Google Maps API, the application will feature an up-to-date direction and geolocation, where individuals were able to navigate safely to the rest stops. Our system contrasts with the fixed maps or simple lists of coordinates, as it becomes a part of the real travel activity.

Additionally, users will be offered with an uncluttered, responsive user interface that will be optimized to be mobile-friendly and allow interaction on the move. This specifically responds to the demands of drivers who might not have the patience and internet capacity to view busy or desktop-propelled websites.

With the database and information related to rest areas managed by the Transport for NSW API node, the platform will display the latest information available about the rest stops, their additions, and any infrastructure modifications without any chances of possible misinformation or stale data.

Like other digital transport projects, transparent, publicly funded datasets should encourage innovation and reuse and also build trust. This ethic is supported by our system that directly exposes quality data to end-users in a usable form to reach the public.

It is with this set of features that the proposed prototype can accommodate a concrete gap in the current transport solutions. It transforms raw data that is in the custody of the government into an intelligent, maneuverable, and ever-changing data service to users of highways. No other application in Australia to date provides such custom combination of real-time assistance in places and personalised access and integration with transport-infrastructure information. We are a team with several innovations up our sleeves, and by developing at both technical and user-experience fronts, we will be aiming to establish a new benchmark in the safety-focused transportation technology design.

# Problem  Statement


Driver energy and sleepiness are great contributors of road accidents. Indicatively, government reports put the figure of road accidents associated with tired driving to 16 to 20 per cent. There are recognized counter measures to the problem e.g. the provision of rest areas in Australia and around the world. But the drivers then do not have easy, aggregated information about the closest rest stop with appropriate facilities as well as where it is. Rest stops can be found on the official maps or road signs but still planning the breaks spontaneously is just a chore. This distance may subsequently cause unsafe behaviors like driving when fatigued and unwarranted halts. The targeted need that we are meeting is a central situation and ease of accessing information on rest areas by users of the road in NSW. At the present moment, the locations of rest areas are available on state-agency websites e.g., on the TfNSW data portal yet this raw information is harder to get and not easily dumped into usable data by the common driver. Travelers (tourists, truck drivers, local commuters) are faced with the problem of manually going through several sources or having to remember them. The proposed project will address the issue by developing an interactive web application that will comprise a system performing the functions of aggregating and presenting all rest-areas data, search, map, and navigation. In such a way, we will facilitate safer and more comfortable taking of planned breaks, thereby contributing to road safety. So in short, we are dealing with the issue of information accessibility and convenience: making it possible to find a nearby rest stop with the facilities a driver needs and have that information within the fraction of seconds, etc. Research proves that rest areas are efficient preventions against safety, thus the ease of locating them has definite advantages.

# Aims and Objectives

Make a user-friendly web application through which all NSW rest areas will be listed along with complete information of the amenities and location and also integrate with an interactive map interface.
Make real-time data accurate by connecting to the Transport for NSW open data API and getting automatic updates on the site content

We should introduce the geolocation search that allows locating the nearest rest areas within a short period of time because Google Maps integration is possible.

Offer maximum search and filter capabilities, thus users can discover the rest areas using the facility type, traveling direction, or distance.

have secure user authentication, that is, require registration/log in to add the personalization and (long-term run) save, and be alerted using, user-specific settings.

The application should apply the responsive web design approach to make it work better across mobile and desktop.

Implement the project under the established schedule following the agile development methodology, where testing is done continuously and each sprint is done once every week

Be ethical and sustainable, using open government data wisely, ensuring the privacy (especially the location data) of the user, and safer transport-related behavior.

These goals are consistent with addressing the detected issue (the need to provide easy access to the rest-area information, which will be up-to-date), as well as fulfilling the university requirement not to overlook the aspects of ethics (the licensing of the data and user privacy) and sustainability, as the safety of the road will be improved.


# Methodology


## Data Sources

We shall use primarily the official NSW Rest Areas dataset that is issued by Transport for NSW. This data is made freely licensed and is frequently updated including the names of rest areas, coordinates, and facilities. It is available through JSON/GeoJSON API. The fact that it is CC-BY-enabled makes it accurate and compliant: as the data is available to us, because of the license we can use and present it in our work, without breaching the copyright, which is both ethical and legal. Any map imagery or APIs of use (e.g. Google Maps) and geolocation and routing will be collected as well. No personal data will be employed. When necessary, we can use supplements such as signage or other sources of park data, but the target will be the rest-areas information of TfNSW.

## Software Tools

Development of web application will be done with following tech and project management stack. 


Frontend Development: Vanilla JavaScript, HTML, CSS and variants of CSS for advancing UI and smooth user experience with responsive interface for different devices and screen size.

Backend Development and API integration: Django will be used for backend development of the web application fetching the information from the NSW API related to rest areas with automatic updation of the  information according to the updates from the official portal. PostgreSQL will be used for as database for sotring the user credentials along with authentication libraries like JWT. 

Project Management: Trello will be used for creating backlogs and completion of the different phases for project completion within the required timeline.

Other tools: Github for version control, draw.io platform for different graphs and charts, MS Word for project documentation, Postman for API endpoints testing, Google Maps API for real time location and Google Scholars and arXiv for academic papers and references.

These tools will help us meet technical requirements. Importantly, using Google Maps and the TfNSW API demonstrates reuse of external resources, in line with practice in similar GIS/web projects.

## Work Breakdown Structure

The collaborative Agile framework will be used, where the development will consist of repetitive sprints aided by a prioritized backlog of products. Principle workstreams are the following:

Sprint 1: Designing and determine requirements. Fine-grained details of features will be written; UI mockups will be created, and technical architecture will be ready. Stakeholders will be consulted to improve on the design offered.

Sprint 2: Add API requests that would allow the retrieval of rest-area information and design a relational database to store data.

Sprint 3: Implement the back-end of the application by creating routes in the servers to handle front-end requests and implementing user registration and log-in features.

Sprint 4: Design an initial application page, a results page and insert an interactive map. Listings of rest-areas and a related information will be provided.

Sprint 5: Add the means of keyword search and filtering by amenity or geographic location.

Sprint 6: Analyze in detail the usability of it, and remove any detected bugs before going back to the user experience and iterating it.

Sprint 7: Peaking, compliance with the responsive design and, where applicable, implement notifications or alerts.

To be able to fulfill efficient responsibilities management in every sprint, the workload is assigned to members on the basis of defined roles. Backlog adjustment will be done as the situation dictates through regular planning and reviews. Contingency has been developed in this eventuality of the quotas or limits being met by Google Maps API; it would involve in such a case having to incorporate the use of the static map references or turning off some of the features on occasion.

## Timeline and Gantt Chart

It has been planned so that the project is in the form of a twelve-week development cycle with milestones on a weekly basis being matched directly against declared project objectives. Every week has the status of a specified one week sprint wherein the team will perform iterative processes of planning, developing, testing and reviewing.

Weeks 1-3: Foundations: The group will complete the specifications of the entire user requirements and create high fidelity mockups of the Listing & Map Integration feature. At the same time, it will create the API Data pipeline by connecting with TfNSW dataset. Week 1 will be allotted to scope approval, completion of wireframes, and development environment. Week 2 and 3 are focused on developing the backend service, which queries and caches rest-area data, and on deploying the first front-end element to list stops and present them on an embedded google-maps.

Weeks 4-6: Core Functionality: In this step the API Data Pipeline will be enhanced by adding operational-status alerts and refreshes logic. At the same time, the Proximity Search feature, or Find Near Me, work, and the simplest filters of the amenities are being started. At the end of Week 6, they will be able to see rest-area information, and search and filter based on location (and simple amenities, e.g., toilets, EV charging).

Weeks 7-9: Advanced Features: The focus is on optimizing Search & Filtering Engine (adding filters by vehicle type, the availability of EVs or not, etc.), and User Authentication (secure registration and authentication, hashing passwords, sessions control). Google Maps navigation will be merged in the interface. To receive feedback on filtering and login processes informal usability testing will be carried out.

Weeks 10–12: Integration & Testing: The last sprint cycle which was dedicated to Account Personalization and End-to-End Testing completion was allocated in the period of Weeks 10 to 12. In the 10th and 11th Weeks, the team was completing a personalization of features in Listing & Map Integration, API Data Pipeline, Proximity Search, User Authentication, and Account Personalization modules, as well as completing unit and integration tests of all of them. The previous work was brought together during Week 12 in terms of intensive functional, performance, and mobile-responsiveness testing, defects identified, correction, as well as the development of documentation and its deployment on the hosting platform.

The 12-week development framework guaranteed that every goal including Listing & Map Integration, API Data Pipeline, Proximity Search, User Authentication and Account Personalization were each taken individually. Sprint reviews as well as weekly stands ups made it easy to monitor progress; agile backlog allowed reorganization of priorities in cases of impediments.

## Change Management and Ethics

We acknowledge that project change is likely (as seen in phase planning). We will manage changes by clear communication in meetings and flexibility in sprints. For ethics and sustainability, we will: use the TfNSW open data under its CC license (attributing it properly); get user consent before using their location; securely handle user credentials (encrypting passwords). We will avoid any practices that compromise user privacy or reuse data unethically. By promoting better rest-area usage, the project contributes to safer, more sustainable travel (reducing crash risk and potentially supporting EV infrastructure usage).

# Roles and Responsibilities

Member W (Backend Developer and Scrum Master): Will be involved in the creation of server infrastructure, the set up of the database as well as the entwining of the API. W organizes meetings, keeps track on the project, makes sure the tasks are running as per timeline, and continuously updates backlog whenever required to.

Member X (Front-end Developer & UI/UX Lead): The Web interface design and implementation. X will come up with user friendly layouts of pages, use Google maps and ensure cross-responsiveness among devices. X leads as well as the CSS and client-side scripting.

Member Y (Full-stack Developer & Tester): Performs front-end work as well as back-end work, especially user authentication (login system) and connect front and back ends. Y performs functional testing of all features, bugs, and also verifies a fix.

Member Z (Research & Documentation): Oversees a literature review and makes an alignment with requirements. Z is a drafting project documentation, a preparation of proposal report, or a control of bibliography. Z also coordinates with such provider of data-source to assure herself of the right to using APIS and cite sources properly.

The communication shall be carried out through weekly video conferences (Zoom) and an active Slack channel that will allow quick coordination. The team utilizes GitHub to control the version, and all code is reviewed by no less than one more member with the help of pull requests. Everyone will be responsible in terms of the allocated responsibilities but there are cross checks so as to ensure quality. In case of some disagreements, the conflict will be solved by the help of the group discussion and the meeting agenda and minutes will be documented to provide the alignment. This is a shared structure of leadership whereby the plan, coding, testing and documentation are shared by all the members.

# Conclusion and Remarks

To sum up, the integrated web-based application can be branded, which will allow all road users to utilize road rest areas in Sydney without much hassle. The application provides up-to-date information on facilities by matching the existing Transport of NSW open data with Google Maps hence facilitating more informed decision making on travel destinations and consequently enhancing safety in roadways. There was an identified gap in available travel-safety resources that the initiative is filling. Methodologically, the project will be based on the agile development framework, but will have extensive planning - anticipating through an elaborate Gantt timeline and strict adherence to the ethical aspects of working on data published by the government. With the help of its demonstration prototype, we hope to see manifested payoffs: drivers will experience shorter search times and more restful hours which fits in the larger picture of complying with the safety of the whole population.

In addition to meeting the course requirements, the project is quite valuable on the practical level. It promotes sustainable transport due to its proposal of taking regular breaks which will ease accidents and indirectly develop safe driving. In addition, charging points of electric-vehicles (EVs) are identified by the system, thus inclining users to use cleaner modes of transportation. The process and the results of development will be documented on a basis of systematization where an intensive use of user stories and tests will prove the quality of the developed artifact meeting the criteria of the university and the needs of road users in NSW.

In the future, live mechanisms that seek user-feedback, validations with the public transport timetables and caching of maps in offline areas with poor connections can be added. In case usage limits set by Google Maps API are exceeded or Transport for NSW data is temporarily unavailable, the system will use cached static maps and locally-stored datasets to continue performing core functionality.
