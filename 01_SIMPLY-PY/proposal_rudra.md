# Park Discovery App for Sydney

**Project Description:** We propose a cross-platform mobile/web application to help residents and visitors discover Sydney’s parks and their amenities. The app will list over 100 major parks around Sydney (from Alexandria Park to Yurulbin Park) and display key features (toilets, seating, playgrounds, BBQs, lighting, parking, dog zones, etc.) for each. For example, **Sydney Park** – a large regional park – offers barbecues, public toilets, shaded seating, a playground, exercise and skate facilities, a café, off‐leash dog areas, and multiple car parks. (See image.) Users can browse parks by name or location, view each park’s details and amenities, and see a map showing the park’s location. The app will also allow user accounts (registration/login), so users can save favorites or leave reviews. Critically, it will integrate Google Maps (or similar) so users can see parks **nearby** and get directions from their current location. Location access permission will be requested to enable this feature. In short, the app aims to become a one-stop guide to Sydney’s park network, addressing diverse needs (families, dog owners, exercise groups, etc.) by aggregating park data in a user-friendly interface.

*Sydney Park (Alexandria) is a multi‑award winning urban park with extensive amenities (public toilets, BBQs, dog off-leash areas, playgrounds, fitness stations, cafe, etc.). Our app will catalogue such features for each Sydney park.*

**Scope:** The application will include the following features and scope of work:

* **Park Database:** Collect basic data (name, address, description, website) for each park, plus the 10 standard attributes listed. Where possible, data will be sourced from official open datasets and council records (e.g. NSW open data “Parks with facilities” listings) and supplemented by manual research. For example, many Sydney parks have known facilities – Centennial Parklands alone draws \~31 million visits/year – and local council pages document their amenities (as City of Sydney’s site shows, “over 400 parks” in the council area). Our team will systematically compile at least 100 Sydney parks with these attributes and store them in a backend (e.g. a cloud database or JSON data).
* **User Authentication:** Implement user registration and login (perhaps via email/password or social login). User accounts will enable personalized features (favoriting parks, submitting feedback). Data privacy will follow standard practices (e.g. hashing passwords, HTTPS). The development will follow ethical guidelines for user data – e.g. only requesting location permission when needed, and allowing users to opt-out.
* **Park Listing & Details:** The app will show a scrollable list or grid of parks. Selecting a park shows details: name, photo, description, and the 10 attributes (e.g. “Public toilets: Yes,” “Dog off-leash: Yes,” etc.). We will use simple icons or checkmarks to indicate presence/absence of features. Park entries will also include an embedded map (via Google Maps API) showing the park’s location. As in the Virginia Beach “Park Finder” app, search results can display both in list and map form.
* **Maps & Location Integration:** A core feature is Google Maps integration. Using a MapView (e.g. React Native Maps) component, the app will allow users to view parks on an interactive map. Users can tap “Find nearby parks” to show parks within a radius of their current GPS location. Clicking on a park marker brings up its details or navigation directions. We will request and use geolocation permissions on the device so that the app can center the map on the user and compute distances. This leverages Google’s location APIs – for instance, the ParkPassport app similarly “helps users discover nearby parks anywhere… by using your location”. The app will also offer driving/walking directions links (via Google Maps intent) to the selected park.
* **Search and Filters:** Users can search parks by name or apply filters by attribute. For example, one could search “park with playground” or filter to only parks with night lighting or BBQs. Implementing such filters requires that all attributes are pre-stored. These search/filter features are inspired by existing park apps (e.g. ParkPassport allows filtering by activities and amenities).
* **Content Creation as Real-World App:** We will design the app to be a realistic product: an intuitive UI (following mobile UX guidelines) and stable functionality. We will handle errors gracefully (e.g. no location access → show park list without nearby filter). The app will be responsive (suitable for phones and tablets) and ensure accessibility (e.g. readable font, screen reader labels). Sustainability is considered by using efficient queries and caching map data for offline use (Google Maps SDK allows offline caching), and by reusing open data rather than redundant surveys.
* **Examples from Existing Solutions:** Note that similar systems exist: e.g., the official NSW National Parks app covers 225 parks with maps, offline downloads, and accessibility info, and the award-winning Parks Australia app uses offline maps, tracking, and content to enhance visits. However, there is no dedicated app focusing on metropolitan Sydney parks. Our project fills this gap by targeting *local* park discovery with amenities filters, which is currently lacking.

**Problem Statement:** Modern city residents and tourists often lack an easy way to find parks that meet their needs. While generic maps show park locations, there is no centralized Sydney park *finder* with detailed amenity info. Users may waste time visiting parks that lack restroom or shade, or not realize nearby parks at all. Likewise, pet owners or families may struggle to identify parks with dog zones or playgrounds. This project addresses that gap by creating a searchable parks directory. In other words, our solution tackles the problem that “previous mobile applications for parks were fragmented and outdated,” by offering a unified app where all stakeholders (visitors, families, dog owners) can quickly locate suitable parks. The core problem is low park discoverability and lack of information; our app solves it by aggregating park data and adding powerful map and filter tools.

## Literature Review

Research shows that park amenities significantly affect user satisfaction and usage. For instance, a Shenzhen study found that physical infrastructure (like recreation facilities, maintained amenities, cleanliness, signage) strongly influences park users’ satisfaction. Common important factors were **recreation facilities** and **maintenance of facilities**, along with elements like signage and cleanliness. Similarly, a 2024 Saudi study found users demanded better accessibility (ramps, seating, restrooms) and adequate lighting in a major park. Only 39% of surveyed visitors were satisfied with park lighting, and accessibility for disabilities was noted as an issue. These studies highlight that features like toilets, benches, and safe night lighting are not optional – they drive usage. Our app directly addresses these factors by listing such attributes for every park (e.g. toilets, benches, lighting).

Existing technology solutions offer useful precedents. The **Virginia Beach Park Finder** app allows filtering parks by amenities and viewing them on a map. Likewise, **ParkPassport** (by the U.S. National Park Trust) covers 1,000+ parks, enables location-based search, and provides park-specific information such as accessibility details. The official **NSW National Parks app** provides downloads, park maps, and location-based discovery for 225 parks. Lessons from these indicate that users expect offline map access, favorites, and robust search by activity. For example, ParkPassport explicitly offers “search for specific locations, various activities” and offline use. We will adopt similar features (location search, offline caching of map when possible) to meet user expectations.

On the development side, there is guidance for park-focused app design. Melo *et al.* (2014) synthesized design guidelines from existing park apps: they recommend a map-centric UI (map filling most of the screen), dropdowns for secondary info, a persistent back button with page title, and consistent color usage across the app. We will apply these usability heuristics to ensure clarity and consistency. Nielsen’s usability principles (e.g. visibility of system status, match between system and real world) will also inform our UI design. Importantly, studies emphasize context-aware mobile features: Carvalho *et al.* note that “context aware mobile applications… enhance the user experience of visitors of natural parks”. Thus, we will leverage the device’s context (user location, time) to prioritize nearby parks and opening-hours info, making the experience more intuitive.

Finally, government and industry reports show growing demand for park access. NSW visitor surveys indicate rising park usage (increases during 2020–2022), underscoring the need for better park services. Parks Australia’s recent “Visitor Experience” app (Good Design Award 2022) illustrates the value of modern tech: it provides **interactive offline maps**, visitor tracking, and cultural content, enabling visitors to *plan and stay safe* in remote parks. While our focus is on urban parks, the success of this app suggests that users do respond well to comprehensive digital guides. In summary, the literature and existing solutions confirm that an app like ours – listing facilities, using maps and search – meets real user needs and follows best practices.

## Aims and Objectives

The project’s goals are to design and deliver a functional parks discovery app for Sydney. Key objectives include:

* **Comprehensive Park Listing:** Compile data for ≥100 parks in Greater Sydney, including their names, locations, and infrastructure attributes (toilets, seating, cafes, lighting, parking, dog areas, etc.).
* **User-Friendly Interface:** Build an intuitive UI (mobile-first) that displays park lists and details clearly. Follow accessibility guidelines to accommodate users with disabilities.
* **Integrated Mapping:** Embed interactive maps so users can view park locations and get directions. Use the user’s GPS location (with permission) to list “nearby” parks and compute distances. (React Native Maps or Google Maps API will be used.)
* **Advanced Search/Filters:** Enable users to search parks by name or filter by features (e.g. “parks with playground and BBQ”). Ensure the search function is fast and accurate.
* **User Accounts:** Implement secure user registration/login to personalize the experience (e.g. saving favorites or adding reviews). Adhere to privacy and security standards (encrypted login, limited data collection).
* **Offline Considerations:** Where possible, allow park info and maps to be cached for offline use, similar to the NSW parks app. This is especially important for users with spotty connectivity.
* **Performance and Reliability:** Test thoroughly so the app remains responsive with multiple users. Optimize map queries and media loading.
* **Ethical & Sustainable Practice:** Ensure the app uses data responsibly, respects user privacy, and promotes social inclusion. For example, accessible design for all abilities and minimal battery/memory usage.

These aims ensure that the final product not only solves the identified problem (poor park discovery) but also aligns with best practices in usability and sustainability.

## Project Plan

We will employ an Agile development methodology with iterative sprints and a backlog. The proposed timeline (12 weeks total) might look like this:

* **Weeks 1–2 (Planning & Requirements):** Define detailed requirements (feature list, tech stack). Create mockups/wireframes. Gather initial park data sources. (We will prepare a *product backlog* listing tasks like “Set up database schema,” “Implement park listing screen,” etc.)
* **Weeks 3–5 (Core Development Sprint):** Implement user registration/login, basic park list and detail screens, and data backend (database/API). Work on Google Maps integration (MapView component and location permission) and park search/filter functionality. Conduct end-of-sprint review and demo.
* **Weeks 6–8 (UI/UX and Refinement Sprint):** Polish the interface (icons, layouts), add images for parks, and ensure responsive design. Complete search filters and map marker info windows. Begin integration testing of features together.
* **Weeks 9–10 (Testing & Bugfix Sprint):** Perform usability testing with sample users; fix any issues. Ensure accessibility (screen reader labels, contrast) and performance (optimize map loading). Implement any remaining features (e.g. favorite parks).
* **Weeks 11–12 (Final Review & Deployment):** Prepare project documentation and final presentation. If ready, deploy the web app to a hosting service and (optionally) the mobile app to a test platform.

We will use tools like GitHub for version control and a Kanban board (e.g. Trello) to track the backlog. Regular stand-up meetings (video or in-person) will be held at least weekly. A Gantt chart will be created to map out these tasks and milestones, ensuring transparency of progress.

*Contingency Plan:* If any feature proves too complex (e.g. advanced photo uploads or offline caching), we will prioritize core functionality and possibly drop low-impact features. For example, if using Google Maps causes API limits issues, we could fallback to static maps. If user login integration delays, we might first launch the app without personalized accounts. The team will continuously reassess scope at each sprint review and adjust the backlog accordingly, ensuring essential goals are met.

## Roles and Responsibilities

With four members, we will assign roles to cover all aspects:

* **Team Lead / Project Manager:** (Member 1) Oversees project timeline, organizes meetings, and ensures deliverables. Also coordinates between front-end and back-end work.
* **Front-End Developer:** (Member 2) Focuses on UI implementation using React Native (or web framework). Builds the park list/detail pages and integrates the MapView component.
* **Back-End Developer:** (Member 3) Sets up the database and API. Gathers park data (from NSW open data or council sources) and writes endpoints for the app (e.g. `/parks`, `/login`). Implements user authentication with secure hashing.
* **Quality Assurance & UX Specialist:** (Member 4) Designs and runs usability tests, checks accessibility compliance (e.g. using screen readers), and writes project documentation. Helps refine the UI/UX based on feedback and oversees final testing.

Each member will contribute code (via a shared repository) and documentation. We will communicate primarily via Slack or Teams for quick coordination, and have at least one full-group meeting per week to discuss progress. Each person is accountable for their tasks on the backlog, and we will rotate note-taking for meeting minutes. In case a member falls behind or is unavailable, others will share the workload; the team lead ensures coverage of duties.

In summary, clear responsibilities and regular communication will ensure all components (data collection, mapping, login, filtering) come together smoothly.
