# Data augmentation using brightness and darkness to enhance the performance of yolo7 object detection algorithm 

## From Abstract

Data augmentation is used for diversifying and expanding the dataset for object detection. YOLOv7 was trained Open Images dataset containing 4 different classes. The dataset was augmented using two different augmentation technique (data brightness and data darkness). Data augmentation contributed to the performance gain for all classes in the dataset by increasing the mAP@.5 value by 13% and F1-score by 11%. 

## From Introduction
Data augmentation techniques increase the size of images and generate new data instead of adding more images to your dataset and labelling them. **The study aims to choose the best data augmentation techniques to help expand dataset and performance metrics including Mean Average Precision (mAP), Precision and Recall for object detection.**

## From Conclusion
