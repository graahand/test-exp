Instruction Finetuning datasets

there are two types of instruction tuning datasets (general instruction finetuning and domain-specific). Instructions are categorize into 10 classes (generation, open qa, brainstorming, chat, rewrite, summarization, classification, other, closed qa and extraction[InstructGPT-sft, Ouyang et al]). 

Reasoning means deriving new judgements from known premises which involves logical reasoning and making inferred assumptions(cot, analogical reasoning and inductive reasoning{making generalizations based on specific observations or examples})
