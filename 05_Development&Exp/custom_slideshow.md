a simple slideshow functionality either in form of flask web app or desktop application with tkinter or any other gui application. *must be visually appealing" 

there should be custom text " Welcome Kavya Gen3" /br
                            "Congratulations on passing something"


below that text there should be the image slideshow. (the slideshow should include the images from a specific folder where the images are added continuosly for slideshow)



a atractive window of resolution 1366 x768 where the background image will be of same size as the windows resolution. in that window the image of a person portrait should be move/slideshowed in loop. the images of the person will be inside a folder named 'slideshow', continuosly loop the image one after another life its coming from left side of the screen and going towards right side, again in that flow, another image will come from left side of the image and then another and then another and then another and likewise in smooth fashion. the path for the background image is given as: "/home/graahand/Documents/background_slide.jpg"   

the images needs to fetched from google drive public folder with link given as: "https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_W1ItIj7zktdqg6CqyE_-8fRWp_Wdwxd?usp=sharing"

instead of html file, create a python file using the library such as tkinter or pyqt compatible with windows and linux operating system both.

move the images at slightly below as compared to now like 1-2cm below

the values for changing the speed of image movement should be explicitly specified for changing it according to the number of the images i have inside the folder. there should be flow images coming continuosly. 

also, the script should automatically sync the new image updated in the folder, for example when running script there might be 10 images, but while the script is running if a new image is added to folder, the script should automatically sync that image as well and include automatically for slideshow mentioned above.
