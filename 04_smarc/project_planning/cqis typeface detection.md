### convolutional neural network for typeface classification

data collection by generating the typeface/font text to image from font file like  .ttf or .otf which are easily available.

generate the images using using openly available tool/model that can be run with  the resources from our pc. 

real world samples will be very valuable.

required samples for each typeface is at least 1000. 

here is the link to the dataset which needs some exploration and can be useful for this task. its a font recognition dataset by Adobe. train data is around 18gb with 2383 font classes. pretrained model is DeepFont produced along with the dataset by adobe research. 

feasiblity and initial reports required fast. 

for now research on vlms is on hold.

Data Collection: Generate text‑to‑image samples from readily available font files (e.g., .ttf, .otf).

Image Generation: Employ openly available tools or models that can run on our local PC resources.

Real‑World Samples: Incorporate genuine usage examples wherever possible.

Sample Requirement: Obtain at least 1,000 images per typeface.

Dataset Reference: Explore the Adobe Visual Font Recognition dataset (train data ≈ 18 GB, 2,383 font classes) and its pretrained DeepFont model:

Timeline: Feasibility study and initial report required by Monday, July 14, 2025.

Current Status: Research on vision‑language models (VLMs) is on hold.
