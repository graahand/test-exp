# STOCK PRICE PREDICTION (PREDICTION AND ANALYSIS)


### model prediction 
    Next day’s Close price (Predicting the exact closing price for next day) (prediction)
    Price movement direction (up/down) (classification)

With Open, High, Low, Close, Percent Change, and Volume is sufficient to compute a wide range of technical indicators like MACD, Bollinger Bands, RSI, Momentum, and more. Adding these derived features will enrich model’s input space and likely enhance prediction performance.


LSTM/DECISION TREE, DATA AUGMENTATION (if possible)

VERY SMALL LLM FOR ANALYSIS AND DESCRITION (OPTIONAL)
