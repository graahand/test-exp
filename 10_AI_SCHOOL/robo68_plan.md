# robo68

phase 1: the robot at a core will be powered by a instruct based llm specifically finetuned for chatting and question answering, tuned/designed for engaging with the individual like chatgpt or siri. 

some of the models that can be used are: 

Note: the code should be functional containing only required functions (function for llm, function for tts, function for stt, function for timezone if required and if possible include function for search functionality to able to search real time information that the model can't provide). I don't want any docstring as well, only add the comments in the code where the code can be modified or replaced with any different value according to requirements. 


text-to-speech need to be implemented with the help of any open-source library (pyttsx3 at least) or any better and human sounding speech conversion. 

speech-to-text will be done using Realtimestt package openly available with github which can transcribe the human voice in real time.

flow: the large language model will be loaded using ollama (ollama run phi3:mini), realtimestt package will transcribe the speech from the user and text transcribed by this package will be passed to the llm as the input based on which the llm  will generate the output (conversation). then the text generated by the large language model will be converted into speech using the library mentioned above. the conversation will continue until and unless the user ask for ending it. 

i need to be able to provide the system prompt to the llm where i will specify its role as helpful robot which can provide answers to various questions along with providing the emotional supports to the users requiring conselling and information regarding the health. 

additionally use any python library to integrate the clock(time) for the robot. the timezone will be Nepal Standard Time (NST), which is UTC+5:45. based on time, the robot/llm should greet the user with good morning, good evening, good afternoon and so on. 


code snippet for realtimestt:
    pip install RealtimeSTT

    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install python3-dev
    sudo apt-get install portaudio19-dev

    from RealtimeSTT import AudioToTextRecorder
    import pyautogui

    def process_text(text):
        pyautogui.typewrite(text + " ")

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        print("Wait until it says 'speak now'")
        recorder = AudioToTextRecorder()

        while True:
            recorder.text(process_text)

    

use pttsx3 for text to speech which is faster.
