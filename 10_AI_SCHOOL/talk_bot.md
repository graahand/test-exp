# talkbot with raspberry pi



stacks: 

pvporcupine for wakeword (good idea, need to download the wakeword model or train again with porcupine)
realtimestt for speech to  text (good idea),
google tts api or any open source model like kokora for text to speech. (good idea with [1] but not resesearch [2])
a llm (brain for the robot) (good idea)
ros for simulation (not researched much)


the llm should be able to manipulate sensors, i need such model whose system prompt can be tweaked and finetuned for good throughput.
