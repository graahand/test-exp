Who am I and What I want to do?
--> I just completed my bachelors from  UK affiliated college in Nepal and waiting for the result and expecting between upper second class honours to first class honours, my major is computing with artificial intelligence. I started working as intern at skill musuem and research center from  the inception of that company, the company is also a sister company of the college I am studying. In that company I worked from my second semester july 2023 and working until now. I am still intern but the term intern doesn't justify what I have done in that company so help me show those things in the cv as well. 

from starting we were team of 4, at that company i was very novice to ai, but learned the fundamentals of Machine learning and python when i was studying at class 11 12, then i started learning deep learning when i was hired as intern in skill musuem. i started learning and experimenting new things, also learned robotics concepts as two persons of the team had have a very excellent working experience and knowlege in robotics but there was none to guide me, i worked out myself, experimented learnt through online resources and gradually improved myself, delivered projects (not full fledge but for exhibition and learning) i worked on project named assisted vision googles (a glass inspired with meta glass) but very basic where i first worked to implement object detection (the assisted vision goggle was based onraspberry pi 4 where i implemented object detection using tflite model along with text to speech)  that was the first step, then we improvised it with ESP32 camera and made the goggle looks and feels good and also a wearable device as the size of esp32 was small i acccessed the camera stream from esp32 camera and processed it in my laptop to perform efficient object detection with yolo and finetuned the yolo on nepali currency for cash detection and counting along with wakeword with porcupine. this goggle was mainlyfocused for visuallyimpaired individuals with long term goal of developing it as a  meta like goggle. 

then  comes new project named stock price prediction where I implemented decision tree and transformer architecture for time series forecasting on Nepse dataset, due to lack of large amount of dataset the accuracy wasn't that good but I learnt the how it  needs to implemented, as the term prediction is wrong in case of stocks as we cannot predict rather we need to work on return, also i implemented the indicators for the stock rise or drop using machine learning libraries. 

then comes another project named self driving car, it wasn't actually a car but first me and my colleage worked on very small picamera and raspberry pi based car with canny edge detection for autonomous control in fixed path, then we added the complexity by implementing the autonomous control in bigger sized car not a real car but a big sized car for experimentation, we implemented instance segmentation it was also built for custom path printed flex, we collected dataset and finetuned the yolo instance segmentation model for segmetnation and implemented the steering using 50kg servo for dynammic steering control with efficient steering control algorithm used inreal world self driving car. 

and then i worked on deepfake detection project where not only me but two other colleagues as well worked combinely to train the deepfake detection model in videos and images by finetuning the lstm and resnet based model for deepfake detection in videos and image, we merged numerous datasets from celebs datasets to many more which i forgot now, this wasn't major or completed project but learned many new concepts that's why i mentioned it. 


these projects were showcased to more than 50000 studnets all over nepal through a tech fest organized by our parent company ING Skill Academy, ING Group, Kathmandu named Futuruma where the assisted vision gogggle, stock price prediction, self driving car were presented by  myself travelling more than 15 cities of nepal from east to west teaching and educating juniours and students about technology, ai, computer science, information technology, and many mmore


i also developed numerous academic projects which is already mentioned in the CV. major projects were (inventory management with python, bonsai ecommerce website with html, css and js, software engineering project sdlc, {servlet, jsp, oop,swing to develop a headphone management system along with web application as well}, dsa with java, my final year project contextual object detection web app with moondream, realtimestt (learned alot about  vision language model, transformers, llms), house price prediction project machine learning (linear regression and xgboost), brain tumor segmentation implemented u-net from scratch achieving over 85% accuracy, worked), (aws deepracer car reinforcement learning)


learned concepts during my tenure as intern in skill musuem and research center are (computer vision, image processing, transformers, rnn, lstm, dataset prepration, dataset developent, hugginface, django backend development, tailwind css, html, js, other are mentioned in cv,, pytorch,)


the project were showcased for hte tech fest but the ultimate goal was research, now we have a department named research and development, our company now have around 40 members from 4 members at beginning. i actively working as lead to the rnd department and working on a research topic realted to image augmentation. the topic was found from the self driving car project. the detailed information will not be disclosed as the paper isn't published and  in on experimental stage but i Learnt the research aspect in computerscience quite well due to this reaearch topic from writing literature review, critical review, proposal, experimentation, analysis, finding gaps, reasearch methodologies and many more from this. and still working on this project. 


additionally my goal at rnd department is fast prototyping and experimentation so i am acitvely experimenting varoious mdoels, finetunging them, testing them from normal text to text model, vision langugage model, mutlimodal, computer vision models and so on. i have good knowlege of generative ai areas from dataset curation, model finetuning, pretraining, reinforcement learning based llm finetuning, sft, trl, rags, and so on. 

i also worked with vairous embedded devices from simple as arduino uno, nano, mega, esp32, nodemcu, raspberry pi 3, 4, 5, zero 2w, jetson nano, jetson orin nano and have experience of implementing these in various projects and real world problems. 


i am not a master but a studnet who have a greater hunger to learn, to continuosly improve, listening to others and understanding is one of my core strength, i also worked at customer service for 3 month and have good and fluent communication skills, leading teams to projects is another skill i acquired, i want to be sponge who can absorb/learn anything, but also want to implement, reproduced those learnt things in real world. these paragraphs aren't complete testament of who am I but gives a superficial idea of who am I and what I represent.
